# Student Lifecycle Management

## Description
The lack of a master database to access a studentâ€™s entire life cycle poses several problems. 
The recruiters have to search all the different places to get a verified list of accomplishments of the applicants. To tackle that we have thought of building a web app with CRUD operations and various roles to keep track of the achievements and accomplishments of a student in one database that can be fetched anywhere with the unique id of the student for review.
